One Collective Sketchpad

As of writing this, I am currently hosting this application locally for the purpose of making it available to "onlookers."

The ngrok link is here: http://eb0651ed.ngrok.io/

If you click that, you'll be able to draw on the canvas, and even invite your co-workers. You'll be able to see each other drawing.


This somewhat exciting project will be iteratively built out in order to become a collective sketch pad, featuring fast-forward and fast-back to view the history of the pad.

This is a work-in-progress. This is a draft write-up that is being added to as the project progresses:
